## Elyra

Elyra is an open-source project that enhances the capabilities of JupyterLab, a popular web-based interactive development environment for data science and machine learning. It provides additional features and extensions to streamline the development and deployment processes.

With Elyra, you can easily create and manage Jupyter Notebooks, pipelines, and machine learning workflows. It offers a visual editor to construct complex workflows using a drag-and-drop interface, enabling data scientists to connect and execute notebook cells as pipeline steps.

Key Features:
- **Notebook Versioning**: Elyra allows you to track and manage different versions of Jupyter Notebooks using Git integration.
- **Pipeline Editor**: Build, edit, and visualize machine learning pipelines through a user-friendly graphical interface.
- **Extension Support**: Elyra offers a collection of extensions to extend JupyterLab's functionality, such as custom metadata editors and pipeline visualizations.
- **Deployment Tools**: Simplify the deployment process by packaging your notebooks and workflows into reproducible runtime environments, such as Docker containers.

Elyra empowers data scientists to collaborate, iterate, and streamline their data science workflows within JupyterLab, making it a valuable tool for building and deploying machine learning models efficiently.


### Adding Elyra Extensions and Building JupyterLab

To include the Elyra extensions and build JupyterLab within the Dockerfile, follow these steps:

1. Add the installation of Elyra extensions to the existing `RUN mamba install -y --quiet` command:

   ```Dockerfile
   RUN mamba install -y --quiet \
           cftime \
           ipympl \
           jmespath \
           psycopg2 \
           boto3 \
           folium \
           tensorflow \
           tqdm \
           lxml \
           pymongo \
           rasterstats \
           geopandas \
           ipywidgets \
           matplotlib \
           scipy \
           lightgbm \
           eo-learn \
           plotly \
           graphviz \
           jq \
           nb_conda_kernels \
           dwave-ocean-sdk==5.5.0 \
           amazon-braket-sdk==1.31.0 \
           elyra \
       && conda clean --all
       
2. The Jupyter build was added to load each Elyra extension into the JupyterLab graphical environment.

   ```Dockerfile
   RUN jupyter lab build
